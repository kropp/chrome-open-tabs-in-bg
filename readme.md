Open Tabs in Background
=======================

This extension makes Chrome behave like Firefox when opening new tabs:

1. New tab always opens in background
2. When you open multiple tabs in a row, every next one opens to the right of the last opened background tab.
   By default they open to the right of the active tab, what I find inconvenient.
